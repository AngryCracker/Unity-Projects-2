# CNNs learn to drive

This repository contains the environment for this project. The environment is just a simple track (circuit). The game was played by actual humans and the data was collected from the screencasts. An ensemble of convolutional neural networks were trained on this image dataset with the corresponding keypress as the label. About 85% accuracy was achieved, but we couldn't try complicated models due to hardware limitations. The convolutional neural network models, dataset and preprocessing functions are in [this repository](https://github.com/ad71/Practical-ML/tree/master/Python%20Plays).

# The Island project

The proposal wrongly redirects the island project link to this directory. [This is the actual directory](https://github.com/ad71/Unity-Projects-2/tree/master/Car%20AI%20GA)
